im Reuploadiing a Modded Reverse Engineered Sorce Code for the Steam Version of Gta 3 and Gta Vice City on Pc only (Called Re3 and ReVc) Here Since the original Github Page that the Creator of this Mod made has been Deleted and Banned by Take Two interactive (The Company Who Own Rockstar Games and Rockstar North) over a Copyright Lawsuit. i obviously Downloaded the Entire Code Long Before it was Deleted and im Reuploading it Here so Everyone can Still Get it Because i Dont Give a Rats Ass About Copyright or What Rockstar or Take Two Thinks and i Believe Modding of Video Games SHould Always be Allowed Especially When it Makes the Game Far Better Then it Normally is and Far More Fun Then it usually Would Be and Not only That but This Mod improves The Graphics and Fixes a Lot of Things that Rockstar Fucked up in The Real Game. in order to use This Mod You Need to own a Copy  of Gta Vice City or Gta 3 on Pc and You Just Have Too Download Wichever File Matches Your Pcs OS (Your Computers Operating System) (The Ubuntu File is for 64 bit Linux Pcs)
(The Mac OS File is Obviously for MacOS 64 bit) (The Win Amd64 d3d9 File is for Windows D3D9 64 bit) (The Win Amd64 Gl3 Glfw File is for Windows OpenGL 64 bit) (The Win x86 d3d9  
mss File is for Windows D3D9 MSS 32 bit)  Extract it with Win rar, and Copy and Paste Your Mod to Your Main File Directory for Gta Vice City or Gta 3 on Your Pc. Then Just start the Game and Your Good. (This was Mainly intended for the Steam Versions of Gta 3 and Gta Vice City but for Some Stupid Fucking Reason Valve Decided to Remove Gta Vice City and Gta 3 and Also Gta San Andreas from Steam Recently So You Cant Buy Those Games on Steam Anymore. The only way you could still get one of these games on steam is if you know someone on steam that bought these games before they removed and never deleted them and you get them to gift them to you or trade them to you. So You will have to download a copy from somewhere else.
